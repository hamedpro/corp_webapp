take care about which license this app should have 
every time you are just showing verified product reviews tell this to the users (also this is true about comments of blog posts)
seperate auth needed routes from others and auth user by either its admin profile or with super admin access token 
use --no-dotfiles when using http-server becuse super admin token and ... are stored in .env
system of preparing git log commits may not work properly on windows (because of line breaks)
