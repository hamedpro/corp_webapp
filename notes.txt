think about a backup system
a part to collect user suggestions and ...
add a blog part
Link to social media 
publish a package which give us what params every api task need and which column does a table have
make sure where lines must happen each after another it happens properly
write something to measure how much time is required for every api task 
work on react native also
configure webserver to add ability of accessing paths from outside the react router dom
nodemon or node shut down server.cjs when something goes wrong but in a lot of cases error can be ignored 

when testing for req per second i saw that after a few seconds of server working good i face the error header cannot be written after it is send (after around 45-60 reqs)

if its required acording to license terms of packages im using, add their names and ... to a file in root before final publish 
take care about todos inside the codes
add count in store and buying basket
if output.css (which is where tailwind writes required classNames) needs to be created before build or dev_watch create it first 
custom ajax is not working and resolve the promise despite there is an error in errors field
when setting up database for first time we also create an admin user with username and password = "root"
crop images when its needed and image frame is square 
instead of this system of adding errors in json reponse and add result : true when we want to tell user nothing went wrong implent a way if there is not any error it means the task is done also with status always be 200
write a good documentaion specially about api and its diffrent errors and add code to errors 
i passed an async function to app.all func of express -> take care about this : passing async functions as callback express js
build a diagram documentation of what is going on in all website
fix the following log  :

add readme md and explain how to run the app for first time
add support for development on another OSs

when pretiere extension is enabled in some cases when i save file it doesnt update output.css (pretiere is set to format on save)
check if it should be reported to pretiere extension or not
add multi language and theme mode (dark or light) support 

reserve a product for a specific time when user adds it to shopping bag

add https support - also care about updating static urls with point to http 
add ability to run server from out of project root (becuse of some relative paths)

in start production script of package json take care about -> server is not up and client makes a request
sometimes after making changes to a jsx component file an error appear in console saying that file does not contains a default export but it does
when trying to change password with task_name = change_password i got error : cannot read property of undefined (password) current line :216
tailwind watch i think either not work or work very slowly even with pretier disabled sometimes i see changes when i save the file for 2nd time 
every price in this app should be in toman
add support for discount


how we seperate frontend routes : 
if paths should be used by both admins and normal users -> keep it outside of admin dashboard and link to that
if just admins should access that information -> put it inside admin dashboard
maybe tailwind css watch script is causing the frontend to sometimes say that component x has not default export when it has or even sometimes its like the styles are not loaded and just html is being displayed
